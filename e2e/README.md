# End-to-End Benchmarks
This directory includes the implementation of RoWild's end-to-end benchmarks.
The full descriptions of these benchmarks, along with their evaluations and
implications, are available in the published
[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626774). Every end-to-end benchmark,
unlike individual kernels, is implemented to be standalone.
