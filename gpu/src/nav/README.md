This directory includes the implementation of navigation kernels. The backend
of all the kernels is the massively-parallel [GA\*
algorithm](https://github.com/zhou13/uastar). It is implemented using the
general-purpose [moderngpu](https://github.com/moderngpu/moderngpu) library.

`car/` includes the implementation of a car navigation scenario.

`drone/` includes the implementation of a drone navigation scenario.

`legged/` includes the implementation of the navigation of a legged robot.
