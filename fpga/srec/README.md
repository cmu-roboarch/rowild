# Scene Reconstruction
This directory provides an implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
for Scene Reconstruction (SR) in Verilog.

## Description
The program captures the shape and appearance of the objects in the 3D
environment shown in the figure below (left). It evaluates different point
clouds using the ICP algorithm to reconstruct the scene; the reconstructed
scene is shown in the figure below (right).
