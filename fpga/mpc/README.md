# Model Predictive Control
This directory contains Verilog code that demonstrates a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) algorithm for a drone navigating in 3D space. MPC is a control
method that utilizes a system model to forecast future states and control the
system to reduce a defined cost over a prediction horizon.
