# POM
This directory provides the implementation of Probabilistic Occupancy Maps
(POM) in Verilog.

## Description
POM creates a spatial representation of an environment based on uncertain
sensor data. The environment is discretized into grid cells, where each cell
represents a probability indicating the likelihood that it is occupied by an
obstacle.
