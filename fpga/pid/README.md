# PID
This directory provides the implementation of the PID controller in Verilog.

## Description
The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is a control loop
feedback mechanism that is used in control systems such as robotics. It
calculates an "error" value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a
measured process variable. The controller attempts to minimize this error by
adjusting the process control inputs.
